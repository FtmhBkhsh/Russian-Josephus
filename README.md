There are n people standing in a circle waiting to be executed. The counting out begins at some point in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a fixed direction. In each step, a certain number of people are skipped (in my code, the number is 1) and the next person is executed. The elimination proceeds around the circle, until only the last person remains, who is given freedom.

### Russian Roulette
